      This is going to look like boring regular text.<br>
      This is filler text.  I am going to type my own filler text until something interesting happens.  Nothing interesting has happened yet.  I want to talk about the html element.  To do this I will need the code element.<br>
      <code>This is going to look like computer code</code><br>
      <code>llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll</code><br>
      <code>The previous code has been  equal length</code>
      <samp>This is going to look like sample code - its monospaced</samp>
    </p>
    <p>
      To copy and paste you would try <code>kbd</code> for keyboard input. Try <kbd>ctrl + c</kbd></p>
      This is a var called <var>x</var><br>
    </p>
    <pre>
    This is line 1

              This is line 3 of the <code>pre</code> element

    This is line 5

    <html>The html doesn't show up here.  to show this kind of element you'll need an html entity</html>
    </pre>
